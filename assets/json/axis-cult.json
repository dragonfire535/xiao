	"Axis Followers can get things done. And because you can get things done, even if it doesn't go well, it's not your fault! It's society's fault that things don't work out!",
	"You can run away from unpleasant things! That doesn't mean you've lost! Because, as they say, \"Sometimes running away is winning\"!",
	"The answer you come to after being in doubt is usually something you'll regret, no matter what you choose! If you're going to regret it anyways, do whatever's easiest for you in the moment!",
	"If criminals have human rights, then NEETS also have human rights! You should not be ashamed of being a NEET, nothing beats living through life without having to work!",
	"You need not to hold yourself back! Drink when you want, and eat when you want! Because you won't know if you'll be able to eat that again tomorrow!",
	"Do not fear growing old! Not even God knows whether or not you will be happy in the future, so you should, at least, be happy now!",
	"Slay the demons! Defeat the Devil King!",
	"ERIS PADS HER CHEST!!!!",
	"Thou shalt love big breasts. Though shalt love small breasts. Whether you're a lolicon or a NEET or a kemomimi lover, with the exception of undead or devil girls, as long as there is love and doesn't break the law, everything will be forgiven."
