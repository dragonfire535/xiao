-Kino's Journey- A hare's encounter

"Kino, isn't it strange." The motorrad asked the traveler.

"What is it, Hermes?" The traveler asked the motorrad.

"No matter how much of a trail we leave on our journey, no one ever follows us." The dust kicked up behind Hermes' wheels as they drove on their way to nowhere in particular.

"That's not strange, it's just not true." Kino answered.

Hermes groaned. "Kino, what do you mean? We've made a lot of enemies on our travels, but I've never seen one behind us."

Kino just laughed. "You don't get it Hermes, just because you can't see them doesn't mean they aren't there."

"Whoa, Kino, why'd you have to mention it like that? That's just creepy." Hermes shuddered.

"Hermes, don't ask questions if you don't want to hear the answer." Kino replied. Just then, they heard a bush rustle. Kino quickly slid down to the ground, hopped off Hermes, and pulled her gun, aiming it at the bush.

After a few more rustles, a lone hare came out of the bush. Seeing Kino with her weapon, it quickly hopped away. Kino put her gun back in its holster and sighed.

Hermes laughed. "Guess I'm not the only jumpy one. Now please pick me up."

Kino smiled. "Nah, I think I'll go on alone. Sorry Hermes." The traveler grabbed her bag from Hermes' rear, and started to walk off.

"Kino, wait, I'm sorry! Come back." Hermes pleaded, as Kino laughed.

"Hermes, we've traveled so long together, you really think I'm not messing with you?"

"How horrible. Who would trick their friend like this? Please pick me up." Hermes continued. Kino finally obliged, righted her partner and hopped onto the annoyed motorrad's seat.

"One thing you said is true, though." Kino stated, as she twisted Hermes' handles to start his engine.

"What is it?"

"What I said was pretty creepy."
